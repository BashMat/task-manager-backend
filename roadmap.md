| Describe deployment process                                      | For project documentation purposes deployment article is required. With this article it will be easier to build and deploy application.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Done        |
| Commit 0.1.0 version                                             | 0.1.0 version denotes more or less finished prototype version. When 0.1.0 version is reached, last commit will be tagged, and project rework will begin to address known issues.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Done        |
| Rework `Boards` functionality                                    | Task functionality faces multiple issues:<br/><ul><li>wrong domain object structure: `Tasks` and their statuses should be core domain objects while `Boards` and `Cards` should be more view-related.</li><li>wrong `Card` ordering approach: it is harder to use `int` values for ordering. Should look into `double` values.</li></ul>                                                                                   | Done        |
| Add integration tests                                            | Integration tests should be useful to test actual API responses automatically.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Done        |
| Commit 0.2.0 version                                             | 0.2.0 version denotes application version with support of new domain model.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Done        |
| Migrate to EF Core                                               | EF Core support was dropped earlier due to experimenting with database model, which was easier with direct scripting. When stable model will be reached, it would be better to use automated approach for migrations. Dapper also showed inconvenience during development.                                                                                                                                                 | Done        |
| Add explicit request validation                                  | Currently there is a minimal validation (for email addresses). Other requests should also be validated: string format, positive/negative numbers and etc.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Done        |
| Refactor project structure into vertical slices (by feature)     | When project becomes bigger, current file structure would be ineffective. Instead of storing files by layers (all services together, all repositories together), they should be stored by slices (slice for task management, slice for notifications, slice for permission management)                                                                                                                                     | Done        |
| Improve API response behaviour                                   | For early development `ServiceResponse<T>` class was created to store response data in a form of object containing response status, message and actual payload data. However, existing RFC offers more specific HTTP response template, which can be used. It would also be useful to reconsider current approach with manual response configuration in favour of domain exceptions, custom middleware or `Result` pattern | Done        |
| Commit 0.3.0 version                                             | 0.3.0 version denotes version with improved behaviour of current API and EF core used as ORM and database schema migration engine.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | In Progress |
| Add support for Refresh-tokens                                   | Currently there is no support for Refresh-tokens. This requires API consumer to request new Access-tokens via sending credentials again after expiration.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Planned     |
| Add history of objects                                           | When working with object, it is useful to see its history: renaming, updating assignees, etc. Different ways of implementation should be considered: Event Sourcing, integrated RDBMS functionality, etc.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Planned     |
| Commit 0.4.0 version                                             | 0.4.0 version denotes version with working Refresh-token based flow and support of object history.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Planned     |
| Add support for user interaction                                 | In early versions only single user functionality was implemented. Now user interaction should be added for actual useful functionality to exist: creating publicly available tasks, managing task assignment, viewing task changes history, and etc.                                                                                                                                                                       | Planned     |
| Add user data reading                                            | Multi-user support makes interacting with other `User` profiles necessary.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Planned     |
| Add setting assignments and commenting                           | With multi-user support, having assignments and commenting becomes useful.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Planned     |
| Commit 0.5.0 version                                             | 0.5.0 version denotes version with actual multi-user work support.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Planned     |
| Add soft delete functionality (archiving)                        | Currently deletion removes records from database. It would be convenient to add soft deletion to some record types.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Planned     |
| Improve API                                                      | Currently API is very simple. It does not handle situations like: default `Tracking Log Entry Statuses` created with new `Tracking Log`; choices between full deletion of all items with certain `Tracking Log Entry Status` or `Tracking Log` (cascade delete); etc. API should be improved to handle different cases.                                                                                                    | Planned     |
| Commit 0.6.0 version                                             | 0.6.0 version denotes version with improved API capabilities.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Planned     |
| Add robust timezones support for date and time data values       | Supporting timezones may be hard. It would be especially problematic if project starts supporting recurring objects and scheduling before implementing actual timezones support.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Planned     |
| Commit 0.7.0 version                                             | 0.7.0 version denotes version with support of timezones.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Planned     |
| Add PostgreSQL support                                           | Microsoft SQL Server is not open-source. It would be better to migrate to PostgreSQL or add support for both RDBMS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Planned     |
| Commit 1.0.0 version                                             | Commit first stable release version.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Planned     |
| Deploy 1.0.0 version to production                               | 1.0.0 version should become available at production level.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Planned     |
| Migrate tasks to production version                              | Application should become actual tool for task management, which means that is should be used to manage application development tasks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Planned     |
| Setup CI/CD pipeline for build versioning and to deploy versions | Currently application version is set manually, and deployment is not automated. After releasing the first stable version automation is required.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Planned     |

## Future Ideas

This table describes less specific plans for future development. These plans have higher chance to be dropped or to be totally reworked:

| Task                                                               | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Status |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|
| Improve version history and add migration guides                   | For `0.x.x` versions no migration guides were provided, making updating inconvenient. Although it is not critical, it would improve project quality if such guides were provided. Migration automation should also be considered (database migration scrips, for example) | TBD    |
| Extract `Authorization` functionality into independent application | `User` management and token issuing process should be independent from task management logic as they can be reused by multiple applications. However, case of access management should be considered before doing so.                                                     | TBD    |
| Add e-mail verification and usage                                  | Currently e-mail addresses are artificial for application: there is no way to use them. E-mail addresses should be verified by e-mail provider to be used later for e-mail notifications and/or `User` functionality (password reset)                                     | TBD    |
| Add attachments for domain objects                                 | Attaching links, files and etc. is an often used functionality, especially in cases of task tracking. Attachments may be added to improve UX.                                                                                                                             | TBD    |
| Improve observability                                              | Metrics are already collected, but observability presents more opportunities. Observability process should be set up to collect, store and process logs, traces and metrics.                                                                                              | TBD    |
| Add notifications                                                  | After adding user interaction functionality, notifications become important to inform about activity: task creation/updating, changes in assignments, and etc.                                                                                                            | TBD    |
| Add documentation web page deployment                              | `.md` files can be used to configure documentation web pages. Being deployed these pages are more useful than separate `.md` files in repository.                                                                                                                         | TBD    |
| Add more clients consuming API                                     | Currently there is an MVP of frontend web application, however, it may be more effective for development and/or usage to consider CLI tool or some messenger chat bot.                                                                                                    | TBD    |
| Add support of different task fields                               | It is natural to have more fields describing task. For example, deadlines, tags, etc. Such labels may be added to `Tracking Log Entries` or even other objects                                                                                                            | TBD    |
