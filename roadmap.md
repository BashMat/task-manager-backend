## Project Roadmap

This table describes more or less specific plans for development:

| Task                                                               | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Status      |

| Describe deployment process                                        | For project documentation purposes deployment article is required. With this article it will be easier to build and deploy application.                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Done        |
| Commit 0.1.0 version                                               | 0.1.0 version denotes more or less finished prototype version. When 0.1.0 version is reached, last commit will be tagged, and project rework will begin to address known issues.                                                                                                                                                         | Done        |
| Rework `Boards` functionality                                      | Task functionality faces multiple issues:<br/><ul><li>wrong domain object structure: `Tasks` and their statuses should be core domain objects while `Boards` and `Cards` should be more view-related.</li><li>wrong `Card` ordering approach: it is harder to use `int` values for ordering. Should look into `double` values.</li></ul> | In Progress |
| Add integration tests                                              | Integration tests should be useful to test actual API responses automatically.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Planned     |
| Add support for Refresh-tokens                                     | Currently there is no support for Refresh-tokens. This requires API consumer to request new Access-tokens manually after expiration.                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Planned     |
| Add support for user interaction                                   | In early versions only single user functionality was implemented. Now user interaction should be added for actual useful functionality to exist: creating publicly available tasks, managing task assignment, viewing task changes history, and etc.                                                                                     | Planned     |
| Change migration model                                             | EF Core support was dropped earlier due to experimenting with database model, which was easier with direct scripting. When stable model will be reached, it would be better to use automated approach for migrations.                                                                                                                    | Planned     |
| Commit 1.0.0 version                                               | Commit first stable release version.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Planned     |
| Deploy 1.0.0 version into production                               | 1.0.0 version should become available at production level.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Planned     |
| Migrate tasks to production version                                | Application should become actual tool for task management, which means that is should be used to manage application development tasks.                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Planned     |

## Future Ideas

This table describes less specific plans for future development. These plans have higher chance to be dropped or to be totally reworked:

| Task                                                               | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Status |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|
| Extract `Authorization` functionality into independent application | `User` management and token issuing process should be independent from task management logic as they can be reused by multiple applications.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | TBD    |
| Add e-mail verification and usage                                  | Currently e-mail addresses are artificial for application: there is no way to use them. E-mail addresses should be verified by e-mail provider to be used later for e-mail notifications and/or `User` functionality (password reset)                                                                                                                                                                                      | TBD    |
| Improve observability                                              | Metrics are already collected, but observability presents more opportunities. Observability process should be set up to collect, store and process logs, traces and metrics.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | TBD    |
| Improve API response behaviour                                     | For early development `ServiceResponse<T>` class was created to store response data in a form of object containing response status, message and actual payload data. However, existing RFC offers more specific HTTP response template, which can be used. It would also be useful to reconsider current approach with manual response configuration in favour of domain exceptions, custom middleware or `Result` pattern | TBD    |
| Add notifications                                                  | After adding user interaction functionality, notifications become important to inform about activity: task creation/updating, changes in assignments, and etc.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | TBD    |
| Refactor project structure into vertical slices (by feature)       | When project becomes bigger, current file structure would be ineffective. Instead of storing files by layers (all services together, all repositories together), they should be stored by slices (slice for task management, slice for notifications, slice for permission management)                                                                                                                                     | TBD    |
| Add documentation web page deployment                              | `.md` files can be used to configure documentation web pages. Being deployed these pages are more useful than separate `.md` files in repository.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | TBD    |
